INGREDIENTS

5 tablespoons butter, plus more for the baking dish
1 pound elbow macaroni
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
6 cups whole milk
2 cups grated Gruyere (8 ounces)
1 1/2 cups grated Cheddar (6 ounces)
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
Kosher salt

DIRECTIONS

Heat oven to 400Åã F. Butter a 9-by-13-inch baking dish or some other shallow 3-quart baking dish.
Cook the pasta according to the package directions.
Wipe out the past pot and melt the butter over medium heat. Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes (do not let it darken). Still stirring, slowly add the milk. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce slightly thickens, 6 to 8 minutes.
Add the Gruyere, Cheddar, cayenne, and 1? teaspoon salt and cook just until the cheeses melt. Mix in the pasta. Transfer the pasta mixture to the prepared baking dish and bake until golden, 25 to 30 minutes.
